        <h2>The Role of Kings</h2>
        <p>During the Middle Ages, kings were the supreme rulers of their kingdoms, responsible for maintaining law and order, defending their realm, and granting land to nobles and knights in exchange for loyalty and military service.</p>
        
        <h2>The Role of Knights</h2>
        <p>Knights were the warrior class of medieval Europe, bound by the code of chivalry. They served their lords and kings in battles and were granted land (fiefs) as a reward for their service.</p>
        
        <h2>The Relationship Between Kings & Knights</h2>
        <p>Kings relied on knights for military support, while knights depended on kings for land and protection. This mutual relationship formed the backbone of the feudal system.</p>
